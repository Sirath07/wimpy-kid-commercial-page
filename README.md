# Wimpy Kid — Interactive Marketing Frontend Experience

## Overview

This project is a front-end marketing website inspired by the *Diary of a Wimpy Kid* franchise. It is designed to demonstrate interactive UI patterns, animation-driven engagement, and structured content presentation typically used in consumer-facing marketing and entertainment platforms. The implementation prioritizes clarity, modularity, and user engagement through lightweight JavaScript interactions.

## Key Capabilities

* Sticky navigation with section-based routing
* Hero section with animated image slider and call-to-action
* Featured books carousel with controlled navigation
* Responsive character showcase using CSS Grid
* Interactive “Fun Zone” including:

  * Personality-style quiz logic
  * Randomized joke generator
  * Dynamic doodle reveal component
* Scroll-triggered animations and progressive content reveal
* Newsletter subscription form with client-side validation
* Visual theming aligned with brand identity and playful UX

## Technology Stack

* **HTML5** — Semantic document structure and accessibility-friendly layout
* **CSS3** — Custom styling, animations, transitions, and responsive design
* **JavaScript (ES6)** — DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI logic

## Architecture & Structure

```
├── index.html        # Page structure and content layout
├── style.css         # Styling, animations, and responsive rules
